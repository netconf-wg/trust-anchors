    <description>
      Certificates built into the device for authenticating
      manufacturer-signed objects, such as TLS server certificates,
      vouchers, etc.  Note, though listed here, these are not
      configurable; any attempt to do so will be denied.

    <description>
      Specific server authentication certificates for explicitly
      trusted servers.  These are needed for server certificates
      that are not signed by a pinned CA.

    <description>
      Trust anchors (i.e. CA certs) that are used to authenticate 
      server connections.  Servers are authenticated if their
      certificate has a chain of trust to one of these CA
      certificates.
