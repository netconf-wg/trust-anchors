      <name>Built-In Public Trust Anchor Certificates</name>
      <description>
        Certificates built into the device for authenticating
        certificates issued by public certificate authorities,
        such as the end-entity certificate for web servers.

        Only the subset of the certificates that are referenced
        by other configuration nodes need to be copied.  For
        instance, only "Public Root CA Cert 3" is present here.

        No new certificates can be added, nor existing certificate
        values changed.  Missing certificates have no effect on
        "operational" when the configuration is applied.
